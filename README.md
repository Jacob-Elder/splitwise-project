# Recreate Splitwise
Today we'll be working on recreating Splitwise with Mongoose, Express,
Angular and Node. That's right, we're using the MEAN stack!

[Splitwise](http://splitwise.com/) is a useful web site dedicated to
helping groups of people split up bills. Multiple users can log on,
create a bill, add expenses to the bill, indicate who has already paid
what, and choose how different things should be split up. It's a useful
tool, and a complex piece of machinery!
